                Coal between the <b>1850s</b> up until the <b>1950s</b> was absolutely essential, and was the highest consumed energy source for America at the time. 
                Coal was one of the major foundations of industrialization throughout the 19th century and its use over petroleum 
                stayed higher by around <b>10~13 QBTU</b> <i>(Quadrillion British thermal units)</i> through the period <b>highlighted in red</b>. Coal's drop suffered at 
                around 1940 was due to a massive coal miner strike with <b>500,000 miners</b>  in April 1943 due to unfair conditions 
                despite President Roosevelt's attempts to make miners adhere to a “ no-strike” period during the Second World War. 
                Nonetheless, <b>coal was still vital</b>

                With a rising necessity for coal in the US, that comes with the rising need for mines, 
                and of course, workers. Colorado Fuel & Iron company (or CF&I), owned by 
                <b>John D. Rockefeller Junior</b>, set up their establishments in Denver and Pueblo in 1892. 
                Their practices, however, were questionable under the Colorado law at the time.
                 They purposely hired as many foreign workers as they were able to, as in the companies eyes, 
                 if they couldn't speak the same language, it would be harder for them to 
                 find a common goal and unite together. The blatant mine saftey violations that were occuring was most likely a factor contributing to 
                 Colorado having twice the national average of coal mine fatalities.
