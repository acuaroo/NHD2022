                Before the Ludlow massacre, the Federal Bureau of Mines was created in the hopes of investigating mines to help protect mine workers right after a few large mine explosions around the country. The Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety acts passed on multiple times after the Federal Bureau of Mines also were signed into effect after noticeable spikes in fatalities of miners. The most effective one being the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety act of 1969, which led 1972-1980’s mine fatalities to plummet 1 thousand casualties.             </p>

                The events sparked stronger enforcement of existing labor laws, and helped grow the demand for labor unions. Labor unions are an orginization formed by workers in a certain industry for the purpose of better pay and working conditions. Eventually in 1935, the Wagner Act was signed by President Roosevelt. This act allowed for the right for workers to freely join and form unions.

                The debate on labor unions still is a matter in today's world, though not on if we need them, rather, should we have them? Many argue that they aren't needed in today's globalized economy, while others say the protection they give is irreplaceable. By 2019, 14 million Americans were affiliated with unions. While the number of people affiliated have gone down, there is still no denying its pressence in todays society. While Labor unions alone are not inhearently controversial, the economic influence and employing of workers still paints a complex view of labor unions in the US today.

                While the Ludlow strikers didn't get the exact requirements they wanted afterwards, they set a basis for future mining conditions and allowed for major improvements all over the country in the labor industry. It's horrifying nature captured the American public, and sprouted a new struggle and era for labor industries laws and practices.
