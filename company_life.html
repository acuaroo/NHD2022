                CF&I set up many company towns, and often required miners to live here with their families. Here, miners would need to buy their own equipment and groceries from the company store meaning when you bought your blasting powder and gear you were practically working for nothing. CF&I also paid around 30 cents cheaper than most companies at the time with a 10 hour work day. If mines weren't able to pay their workers they would give them company scrip, a system acting as fake money which could be exchanged at a store to USD with an extra fee.

                Strikers had been protesting about their conditions for over 50 years, although payment was one of the changes they wanted, it wasn't their main point. Colorado already had laws in place to help protect miners, but all of them were being broken by CF&I. Even when Colorado attempted to change their laws to stop this, CF&I only pretended to comply.

                Strikers often damaged company mines and property and mine guards retaliated. 
                September 16th, 1913, the official call to strike was sent.
                Strikers were evicted from company towns and made tent colonies, the main tent colony being Ludlow. They wanted to refute the idea that strikers were savages, so they had a medical tent where they treated people and did stereotypically “American” things like playing baseball.

                Skirmishes often took place between the strikers around the recently brought in militiamen. Militia would shoot into the tent colony more to disrupt the colony.

                Louis Tikas, a Greek miner, acted as a leader of the tent colony. His interest was in peace and negotiations between CF&I and the strikers, however these attempts of diplomacy were shattered. CF&I eventually had enough of this strike, leading to the
