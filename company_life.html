                CF&I set up many company towns, and often required miners to live here with their families. Here, miners would need to buy their own equipment and groceries from the company store meaning when you bought your blasting powder and gear you practically working for nothing. CF&I also paid around 30 cents cheaper than most companies at the time with a 10 hour work day. If mines weren't able to pay their workers they would give them company scrip, a system acting as fake money which could be exchanged at a store to USD with an extra fee.

                Strikers had been protesting about their conditions for over 50 years, although payment was one of the changes they wanted, it wasn't their main point. Colorado already had laws in place to help protect miners, but all of them were being broken by CF&I. Even when Colorado attempted to change their laws to stop this, CF&I only acted like it was following them.

                Strikers often damaged company mines and property and mine guards retaliated. Once the strike of 1913 began, strikers were evicted from company towns and made tent colonies, the main one being Ludlow. They were playing against the idea that the strikers were savages, so they did "American" things like playing baseball and having a medical tent where they treated people.

                Skirmishes often took place between the strikers around the recently brought in militia men. Militia would shoot into the tent colony more to disrupt the colony.

                Louis Tikas, a Greek miner, acted as a leader of the tent colony. His interest was in peace, and negations between CF&I and the strikers, though his attempts of diplomacy were shattered. Over time, CF&I had had enough of this strike leading to the
