                CF&I set up many company towns, and often required miners to live here with their families. 
                Here, CF&I would set up company towns where miners would need to buy their own equipment and 
                groceries, ultimately bringing back the money to the company. At the end of the day, when 
                you bought your blasting powder, gear, and groceries it resulted in practically working for 
                nothing, as everything they made was then spent and sent to the company to pay mine guards 
                & operators. CF&I's domination of the Southern Colorado coalfields wasn't solely reliant on it's 
                workers being mainly foreign though. CF&I paid around 30 cents cheaper than most companies at the time in conjuction with the 10 hour 
                work day. If mines weren't able to pay their workers (mainly in the earlier days of the company)
                they would give them company scrip, a system acting as a fake money that could be
                exchanged at a store or transfered to USD with an extra fee.

                Strikers had been protesting about their conditions for over 50 years at this point,
                and although payment was one of the main things they wanted to change, it wasn't their main point.
                Colorado already had laws in place to help protect miners, but all of them were being
                broken by CF&I, and even when Colorado attempted to change their laws to more heavily effect
                CF&I, CF&I only acted like it was following them.

                <br/>
                Strikers often damaged company mines and property, and mine guards reubuttled. Once
                the main strike began, strikers were evicted from company towns and had to make
                tent colonies, the most famous of which is the Ludlow tent colony. They were 
                playing against the idea that the strikers were savages, so they purposley did
                "American" things like playing baseball as a past time and having a 
                medical tent where they treated people.

                Louis Tikas was a greek miner who acted as a leader of the tent colony.
                His main interest was in peace, and negotions between CF&I and the strikers,
                but his attempts of <b>diplomacy</b> were shattered. Over time, CF&I had
